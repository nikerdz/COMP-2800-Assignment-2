## How to Run

### Option 3: Visit the Game's Webpage

The game has been hosted through Microsoft Azure - Static Web Apps.

Visit the site at this link to play the game: https://proud-smoke-04b391d1e.1.azurestaticapps.net/

### Option 2: GitHub Codespaces

1. Open the project in **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Run:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open the forwarded port in your browser

### Option 3: Local Development Server

You can also run the project using a local server such as:

* VS Code Live Server
* Python HTTP server
* any simple static file server

Example with Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

* Each enemy destroyed gives **100 points**
* The game ends in a **win** when all enemies are eliminated
* The game ends in a **loss** if:

  * the hero loses all lives, or
  * an enemy reaches the hero's row

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6)**
* **Canvas API**

---

## Assets

The game uses the following image assets inside the `assets/` folder:

* `enemyShip.png` – enemy sprite
* `player.png` – player ship sprite
* `laserRed.png` – laser sprite
* `life.png` – life icon shown on screen

---

## Implementation Overview

This game is built around:

* an **event-driven system** using a custom `EventEmitter`
* a base `GameObject` class for shared object behavior
* subclasses for:

  * `Hero`
  * `Enemy`
  * `Laser`

The game loop continuously:

1. updates object positions
2. checks collisions
3. removes destroyed objects
4. redraws the scene

---

## Possible Future Improvements

* Different enemy types
* Level progression
* Sound effects and music
* Explosion animations
* Pause functionality
* Start screen / menu
* High score tracking
